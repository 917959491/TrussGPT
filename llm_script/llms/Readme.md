This project uses the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model as the default large language model (LLM).
For enhanced performance, especially in complex generation or reasoning tasks, you may consider using larger models (e.g., Qwen2.5-14B or Qwen2.5-72B), which generally offer improved accuracy and understanding capabilities at the cost of higher computational requirements.
